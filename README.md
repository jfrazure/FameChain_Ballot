# FameChain Ballot

# Capstone Project 3 for SMU Fintech
## Team Members:
## Jahun Moayezdzadeh
## Daniela Catalan
## Jonathan Frazure

### Background:

FameChain is a new age Digital Asset Exchange that has attracted new assets and various famous and pseudo-famous coin traders since inception.  The management team is looking to use this newly found success to strike while the iron is hot, and use the extent of our marketing budget to create a campaign to take FameChain to the next level and even possibly to the very top with some luck and the right endorsement.  We have been in touch with various celebrities who are well versed in the crypto game and hold assets within the FameChain Exchange that could have interest in performing an extensive online and television ad campaign to exponentially boost our exposure and in turn, what we hope to be explosive growth.  

We are going to put the job of choosing a face for our campaign to our esteemed exchange members by establishing a blockchain voting system where each exchange member receives one vote.  Members will be able to post their votes on the exchange for a small fee, and we hope to have 100% participation since this heavily influences the future prospects for growth and liquidity for us all.  Using the blockchain will help us make sure that each member gets one and only one vote, and that non-members will not have any influence over the outcome in any way.  We look forward to seeing whom our members will select!

The nominees in question for this prestigious campaign are as follows:

## Elon Musk - CEO and Chairman, TechnoKing of Tesla Motors and SpaceX

Campaign Slogan:  "DogeCoin to the Moon!"

## Snoop Dogg - aka Calvin Cordozar Broadus, Jr., OG of Long Beach and World Famous American Rapper

Campaign Slogan:  "Scooping Up That Bizzy, Making you Dizzy"

##  Mike Tyson - former Boxing Heavyweght World Champion and Actor

Campaign Slogan:  "The Champ of Knocking Out Cash"

##  Billie Eilish - world famous performer and multiple Grammy, AMA, VMA Awards winner

Campaign Slogan:  "Bitcoin's Bad Girl"

## Paris Hilton - reality TV star and and heiress to the Hilton Group Hotel fortune

Campaign Slogan:  "That's Hot"

### What You're Creating:

We want to begin the assignment by building a python file in VS Code that will lauch a Streamlit Voting Interface where our exchange members will be able to enter their respective digital wallet codes and securely vote for an small exchange fee.  Votes will be tallied as they arrive in through the application, and we intend to name a winner once we have achieved a quorum result within a specified voting time period.  Results will be definitive and binding, and FameChain will move forward with an all-encompassing global campaign with our new celebrity spokesperson.

We plan to simulate the exchange votes

### Instructions

The steps for this challenge are broken out into the following sections:

* Build a Front-End Python script that will create a Streamlit application
* Build a ReMix solution file that will accept digital wallet IDs and payments to secure simulate exchange member votes
* Tabulate the results via Streamlit and name a winner (Celebrity Spokesperson), then tabulate funds raised for the exchange by the interactive vote.
